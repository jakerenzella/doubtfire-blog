Welcome to the February 2020 update to Doubtfire. There are a number of significant feature enhancements in this release which we hope you will like. Some of the key highlights are:


![Update image](./update.png)

* [Campus Support](#campus) - Tutorials and student enrolments are now linked with campuses.
* [Tutorial Streams](#streams) - Each unit now has tutorial streams, so you can have a Prac and a Seminar in the same unit for different student types.
* [Smart Syncing](#syncing) - Unit rollovers, system integrations means you can spend less time on admin tasks.
* [Reply Comments](#reply) - You can now reply to any individual task comment.

And if you want a peek under the hood...

* [Platform Updates and Optimizations](#development) -- We have made changes to enable bundle optimisations in the load times of Doubtfire.


## <a name="campus"></a> Campus Support
Campus support categorises students based on their campus location, or cloud. It supports mixed campus-based and online-based students, and can ensure students of one campus can not move into tutorials of another campus.

## <a name="streams"></a> Tutorials Streams
Tutorial streams allow you to support multiple tutorial types within a unit. For example, a unit like Introduction to Programming could have a practical, workshop and a tutorial all running for different student types. These are optional, so if a unit only has one type of tutorial then you can leave this setting unset. This feature is particularly useful for units with mixed campus and online cohorts.

## <a name="syncing"></a> Smart Syncing
Smart syncing supports deep integrations with your institution's settings to sync student enrolments, tutorials, locations etc.

## <a name="reply"></a> Comment Replies
You can now reply to individual comments within a task panel, useful for when you are responding to a number of comments at once. Simple click the reply button next to a comment and start your response. You can respond to and with text, audio or image comments!
